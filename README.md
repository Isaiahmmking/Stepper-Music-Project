# Stepper-Music-Project
*TL:DR at end*

Basic description: This is a project I built to help my understanding of javascript. It is a musicial instrument made from stepper motors. 

# Project idea 
  I first came up with the idea to create this project when during me freshman year of university. I was building a personal project and required more materials from the parts store. There, I saw a display that used a stepper motor. in this display, they were rotating a heavy weight to show the strength of the motor, but what was more intriguing to me was the noise the motor was making. although it was impressive that the motor was very strong, it was also releasing a pitch similar to an electric piano. So instead of puchasing the parts I originally went to the store for, I purchased a few stepper motors and decided to try and make a new stepper motor piano!

To my enjoyment, I found that this project has been completed by a few other people, specifically, I watch this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFHpNFJlB0w) about someone implementing MIDI files through JS to connect the motors to specific pitches based on their rotational speed. I followed his original ideas and obtained the necessary parts to build the project. I had very little experience with an arduino so this project was very educational for me in that way. 

After constructing the circuit, I noticed areas where the device could be improved.
